A10: A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5. What is A:C?



✅ A1: A : B = 2:3, B : C = 4:5 → Make B same
→ A:B:C = (2×4):(3×4):(3×5) = 8:12:15 ✅

✅ A2: Total = 1+2+3=6, Share = 4000
→ Value per part = 4000/6 = ₹666.67
→ Shares: 666.67, 1333.33, 2000 ✅

✅ A3: Total parts = 3+4=7.
→ 56 ÷ 7 = 8, A = 3×8 = 24, B = 32 ✅

✅ A4: Work = men × days = 8×10 = 80
→ New days = 5, so men = 80/5 = 16 ✅

✅ A5: Combined = LCM / (Sum of times) = (6×12)/(6+12) = 72/18 = 4 hrs ✅

✅ A6: Formula → Net % = x + y + (xy/100)
= 25 - 20 - (25×20)/100 = 5 - 5 = 0 → NO profit ✅

✅ A7: 20% = 60 → 1% = 3 → 100% = 300 ✅

✅ A8: x = 20, y = -20 → Net % = x + y + (xy/100)
→ 20 - 20 - (20×20)/100 = -4% loss ✅

✅ A9: B:G = 4:5 → Total parts = 9
→ Boys = (4/9) × 180 = 80 ✅

✅ A10: Combine A:B:C (see A1) = 8:12:15 ✅
